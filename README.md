# Peanuts app ðŸ¥œ
Heavily work in progress btw, it's public so I can learn how to use git more and share it easier with others.
## What's this?
In short - that's the QoL web app that I made for me and my friends. We used to keep ton of excel spreadsheets for many important (or not so much) things. Finally I decided that I will make one site to rule them (spreadsheets) all.
## Can I use it too?
Sure, you will probably have to fill many things manually but program itself should be working just fine. Just not yet, it's not finished.
## What will it do?
Main two things that I want to incorporate in this site are death tracker for soulslike games and role queue tracker for Dota 2.
### Soulslike games death tracker?
We use to keep track of how many deaths each of us achieve on individual bosses of soulslike games and we like to compare between our results.
### Dota 2 role queue tracker?
We start playing ranked games with all roles toggled on. After game we untick played role and continue doing so until we run out of roles. Then we tick all roles again and cycle repeats. 
## What are the technologies used?
They main technology used here is Python framework - Django. Also obviously (for a site) there is HTML, CSS (probably will add SCSS/SASS too), databases (default Django SQLite, later probably PostgreSQL too) and JavaScript (with React integration later).
